      "question": "Compare the different types of generative models: GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models.",
      "answer": "GANs use two competing networks (generator creates synthetic data, discriminator identifies real vs fake) in adversarial training. VAEs combine encoder (maps input to latent space) and decoder (reconstructs data) with probabilistic latent space for generation. Diffusion models gradually add then remove noise through forward and reverse diffusion processes.",

      "answer": "Trade-offs include accuracy (complex models more accurate but less interpretable), privacy (privacy-preserving techniques reduce transparency), safety constraints (filtering outputs reduces transparency into reasoning), and security (secured models less open to auditing).
