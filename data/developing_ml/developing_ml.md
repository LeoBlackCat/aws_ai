# Introduction

In this machine learning course, you will learn about the machine learning lifecycle, and how to use AWS services at every stage. Additionally, you will discover the diverse sources for machine learning models and learn techniques to evaluate their performance. You will also understand the importance of machine learning operations (MLOps) in streamlining the development and deployment of your machine learning projects.

# Machine Learning Development Lifecycle

## ML development lifecycle
Machine learning (ML) lifecycle refers to the end-to-end process of developing, deploying, and maintaining machine learning models.

The end-to-end machine learning lifecycle process includes the following phases: 

Business goal identification
ML problem framing
Data processing (data collection, data preprocessing, and feature engineering)
Model development (training, tuning, and evaluation)
Model deployment (inference and prediction)
Model monitoring
Model retraining
The following illustration shows how the phases work together
