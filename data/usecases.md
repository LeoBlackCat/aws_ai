You have learned how AI contributes to various industries and the different applications used to create solutions. In the next section, you will learn about ML.

# Machine Learning
![](Diagram_NOPROCESSS_Machinelearning2.png)

Remember, ML is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models so that computer systems can learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. ML models learn patterns and relationships from data rather than relying on hard-coded rules for instructions. These models are trained on large datasets, and their accuracy and performance improve over time as they process more data. 

In this section, you will learn about when ML is an appropriate solution and the techniques used for specific use cases. 

## When AI and ML are appropriate solutions
To determine the appropriate AI solution, you must understand when to use AI to resolve a business problem. AI is a good choice for the following use cases:

- Coding the rules is challenging: Many human tasks cannot be solved properly using simple, rule-based solutions. Take spam filtering for instance. Determining whether an incoming email is legitimate or spam is a complex task that cannot always be effectively tackled through a set of predefined rules. There are many variables at play.  When rules rely on too many factors, have overlaps, or need to be finely tuned, it becomes difficult for humans to code them accurately. ML can be used to effectively solve this kind of problem.

- Scale of the project is challenging: In the spam filtering example, a human might be able to look at a few hundred emails and decide if they are spam or not. However, scaling this task to scan through millions of emails would be tedious and inefficient. ML solutions are appropriate for large-scale problems like this.

## Alternative approach to AI and ML
Notice in the previous section that AI can solve many problems. However, there might be situations where alternative approaches would be more suitable. Consider all approaches and select the most appropriate one based on the task’s specific requirements and constraints. 

For example, you do not need ML if you can determine a target value using simple rules, computations, or predetermined steps. You can program the steps without needing any data-driven learning. 

You have learned when AI and ML are appropriate and when an alternative solution is appropriate. Next, you will learn about ML techniques for selecting a model.

# Machine Learning Techniques and Use Cases
When choosing an ML solution, it’s not just about the technology, but also about understanding the appropriate ML techniques for specific use cases. ML learning techniques represent the backbone of modern AI and empower systems to learn from data and make intelligent decisions without explicit programming. These techniques include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, which each serve a distinct purpose. 

**To learn the definition of these techniques, choose each of the markers.**

## Supervised learning

In supervised learning, the algorithms are trained on labeled data. The goal is to learn a mapping function that can predict the output for new, unseen input data.

## Unsupervised learning

Unsupervised learning refers to algorithms that learn from unlabeled data. The goal is to discover inherent patterns, structures, or relationships within the input data. 

## Reinforcement learning

In reinforcement learning, the machine is given only a performance score as guidance and semi-supervised learning, where only a portion of training data is labeled. Feedback is provided in the form of rewards or penalties for its actions and the machine learns from this feedback to improve it decision-making over time.

## Supervised learning use cases
Supervised learning is a popular type of ML because it’s widely applicable. It’s called supervised learning because there needs to be a supervisor. The supervisor is labeled training data. Like any student, a supervised algorithm needs to learn by example. Essentially, this type of algorithm uses training data to help determine the patterns and relationships between the inputs and outputs. For example, pictures of cars labeled by people as cars are provided to the model. Then, when the model receives a new picture of a car that is not labeled, the model can predict that it is a car.

![](Diagram_NORPOCESS_Supervisedlearning.jpg)

The model learns by identifying patterns in data that's already labeled.

**Types of supervised ML**

Supervised learning has two subcategories—classification and regression. 

### CLASSIFICATION
Classification is a supervised learning technique used to assign labels or categories to new, unseen data instances based on a trained model. The model is trained on a labeled dataset, where each instance is already assigned to a known class or category. The goal of classification is to learn patterns from the training data and use them to predict the class or category for new unlabeled data instances.

**Use cases include the following:**
- Fraud detection
- Image classification
- Customer retention
- Diagnostics

REGRESSION
Regression is a supervised learning technique used for predicting continuous or numerical values based on one or more input variable. It is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (the value to be predicted) and one or more independent variables (the features or inputs used for prediction).

**Use cases include the following:**
- Advertising popularity prediction
- Weather forecasting
- Market forecasting
- Estimating life expectancy
- Population growth prediction

## Unsupervised learning use cases

Recall that in supervised learning, the data includes labels so that the model can learn the patterns and relationships. In unsupervised learning, the model is trained on unlabeled data. The algorithm tries to discover hidden patterns or structures within the data without any prior information or guidance.

In this type of learning, the machine has to uncover and create the labels itself. These models use the data they’re presented with to detect emerging properties of the entire dataset and then construct patterns.

![](OriginalData_Unsupervised.png)

In unsupervised learning, labels are not provided—you don't know all the variables and patterns.

Types of unsupervised ML

Unsupervised learning encompasses various techniques and algorithms. Two main subcategories of unsupervised learning are clustering and dimensionality reduction. 

### CLUSTERING

A common subcategory of unsupervised learning is clustering. This kind of algorithm groups data into different clusters based on similar features or distances between the data point to better understand the attributes of a specific cluster.

For example, by analyzing customer purchasing habits, an unsupervised algorithm can identify a company as being large or small.

**Use cases include the following: **
- Customer segmentation
- Targeted marketing
- Recommended systems

![](Diagram_NOPROCESS_ClusteredData_Unsupervised.png)

### DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION
Dimensionality reduction is an unsupervised learning technique used to reduce the number of features or dimensions in a dataset while preserving the most important information or patterns.

**Use cases include the following:**
- Big data visualization
- Meaningful compression
- Structure discovery
- Feature elicitation

## Reinforcement learning use case
Another kind of algorithm that has gained popularity recently is reinforcement learning. Unlike the first two algorithms, this one continuously improves its model by mining feedback from previous iterations. In reinforcement learning, an agent continuously learns through trial and error as it interacts in an environment. Reinforcement learning is broadly useful when the reward of a desired outcome is known, but the path to achieving it isn’t—and that path requires a lot of trial and error to discover.

![](Picture4.png)

The agent is the virtual car, and the environment is a virtual racetrack.

For example, in the AWS DeepRacer simulator, the agent is the virtual car, and the environment is a virtual racetrack. The actions are throttle and steering inputs to the car. The goal is completing the racetrack as quickly as possible and without deviating from the track.

The car needs to learn the desired driving behavior to reach the goal of completing the track. To learn this, rewards are used to incentivize the model to learn the desired driving behavior.

In summary, as you can see in the following graphic, machine learning techniques encompass diverse methods, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning has two subcategories: classification and regression. Similarly, unsupervised learning has two subcategories: clustering and dimensionality reductions. To use the full potential of ML, you should understand the principles and applications of these techniques.

This is a non-exhaustive list of generative AI capabilities. Overall, generative AI capabilities are diverse and evolving. They offer endless possibilities for innovation, creativity, and problem-solving across industries and applications.

# Challenges of Generative AI

While AI offers many capabilities, some challenges include regulatory violations, social risks, privacy concerns, toxicity, hallucination, and interpretability. These challenges are important to take into account because a model has the potential to make decisions that are unethical or socially irresponsible. Review the list below:

## Regulatory violations
**Risk**
Generative AI models trained on sensitive data might inadvertently generate an output that violates regulations, such as exposing personally identifiable information (PII).

**Mitigation**
To minimize the risk of privacy violations, implement strict data anonymization and privacy-preserving techniques during model training. To ensure compliance with privacy regulations, conduct thorough audits and assessment of the data used to train the model.

## Social risks
**Risk**
The possibility of unwanted content that might reflect negatively on your organization is a social risk.

**Mitigation**
Test and evaluate all models before deploying them in production.

## Data security and privacy concerns
**Risk**
The information shared with your model can include personal information and can potentially violate privacy laws.

**Mitigation**
To protect sensitive data, implement cybersecurity measures, such as encryption and firewalls.

## Toxicity
**Risk**
Generative AI models can generate content that is inflammatory, offensive, or inappropriate.

**Mitigation**
- Curate the training data by identifying these phrases in advance and removing them from the training data. This prevents them from being generated as output.
- Use guardrail models. These models will detect and filter out unwanted content.

## Hallucinations
**Risk**
The model generates inaccurate responses that are not consistent with the training data. These are called hallucinations.

**Mitigation**
Teach users that everything must be checked. Foundation models (FM) can’t be trusted to verify their own stories are based in reality and on facts. Hallucinations could be further mitigated by checking that content is verified with independent sources. Also, generated content can be marked as unverified to alert the user that verification will be necessary.

## Interpretability
**Risk**
Users might misinterpret the model’s output, which could lead to incorrect conclusions or decisions.

**Mitigation**
Use specific domain knowledge for model development and performance by providing key information for data model inputs. 

## Nondeterminism
**Risk**
The model might generate different outputs for the same input, which can cause problems in applications where reliability is key.  

**Mitigation**
Perform tests on the model to identify any sources of nondeterminism. Run the model multiple times and compare the output to ensure consistency.

These challenges address issues related to data quality and bias. By proactively addressing them, customers can experience the full potential of generative AI, while verifying its responsible use across various domains.

**You have learned about the capabilities and challenges of generative AI. In the next lesson, you will learn about factors to consider when selecting a generative AI model.**

# Factors to Consider When Selecting a Generative AI Model

## Performance requirements
Performance requirements are another factor to consider when selecting a generative AI model. These requirements include accuracy, reliability of the output, and others. Assess the overall performance of the model to evaluate its suitability for a particular task. You should also test the model against different datasets to ensure reliability. Finally, monitor its performance over time to ensure it remains consistent. 

## Constraints
Consider the constraints of a model such as the following: 

- Computational resources (for example, available GPU power, CPU power, or memory)
- Data availability (for example, size and quality of training data)
- Deployment requirement (for example, on premises or cloud)
Some models might have higher resource demands or require specific hardware configurations, which could impact their use case.

## Capabilities
Another factor to consider is the model's capabilities. Generative AI encompasses a wide range of capabilities. It can perform different tasks with varying degrees of output quality and levels of control or customization. For instance, some models might be better at generating text, whereas others might excel at generating images or performing multimodal tasks such as text-to-image generation. Therefore, it is important to understand the specific capabilities required for your application before selecting a generative AI model.

## Compliance

Compliance is another factor. Generative AI models can pose moral concerns, including biases, privacy issues, and potential misuse. When evaluating a particular model, consider its compliance and moral implications, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare, finance, and legal applications. One should consider factors such as fairness, transparency or traceability, accountability, hallucination, and toxicity. Additionally, the model should adhere to relevant regulation guidelines.

## Cost
Another key factor is cost. Generative AI models can vary in terms of cost. Consider the trade-off between the size and the speed of the model. Larger models are usually more precise, but they are expensive and offer few deployment options. Conversely, smaller models are cheaper and faster, and they offer more deployment alternatives.

By using generative AI for content creation, you can reduce labor costs and increase efficiency, especially for repetitive tasks that require significant human effort.

Remember to evaluate all expenses related to deployment, maintenance, hardware, software, and other associated costs.

By considering these factors, you can select a generative AI model that best fits your specific needs.

Now that you understand the factors to consider when selecting a model, let's discuss some key business metrics associated with AI models.
